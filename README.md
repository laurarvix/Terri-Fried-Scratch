# Terri-Fried Scratch Port

A while ago I made a valiant effort to translate the game to a Scratch project and it is currently considered to be the best version on Scratch. However, even with that it still sucks, so I'm redoing it. The old version can be found linked to in the releases tab and the .sb3 can be found in the "\Scratch\old\" directory. The "\Scratch\current\" directory will receive an .sb3 file for every developed version, and once I have finished the new port, it will be added as a new release. I will also potentially create an improved version with the Turbowarp compiler, which will likely be hosted here under deployments. I've chosen to delete all the files in the original repo as they're not needed here, but all of the assets from the original windows version are in "\scratch\assets\" as the ones used in the new version might need to be modified.
